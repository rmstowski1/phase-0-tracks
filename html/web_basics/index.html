	<h1>The Earth.</h1>
	<body>
		<p>Hello World and <strong>all</strong> who inhabit it! The Earth is an <em>amazing</em> Place, lets not destroy it because of human error! Some of the main reasons for the Earths diminshing lifespan are:
		<ul>
			<li>Industrial Admissions</li>
			<li>Poor disposal of waste</li>
		    <li>Deforestation</li>
		    <li>Use of fossil fuels</li>
		</ul>

		I know this is very sad but fortunately its not too late. There are plenty of ways anyone can help keep the Earth in good shape are:
        <ol>
        	<li>Recycle</li>
            <li>Turn off anything you aren't using</li>
            <li>Use energy efficient lightbulbs</li>
            <li>Dont litter</li>
        </ol>
